# Rcodes: What are these? 
- These are basically the R codes that I used for my assignments for SNU GSIS and CSS classes.
- These include:
   1. GDP per Capita and Growth Calculation
   2. .... and so on.
- Simply, not so much.
   ...Yet will update more and more, for the concept of recycling. 
   *heavily influenced by Michael J. Mahometa's SDSRegression package.*
